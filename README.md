# blackbelts
## Description
A Hall-of-Honor-esque web app to display the Instructors of a martial arts school,
and to honor those that have received black belts at that school.

## Installation
1. add the repo to your project folder,
2. type "'blackbelts'" into Installed Apps, and
3. include the blackbelts app urls to the main project folder's url patterns.

## How to Use
This one's a relatively simple one. A user would simply need to add a person who has achieved the rank of black belt to the list. If that person has an Instructor Bio, he or she will be added to the list of Instructors at the top.
